### Electronic Health Records using Blockchain-Hyperledger

Health records often exist in silos and are incompatible with each other which makes data-sharing difficult. The user has to then resort to doing the work manually. Patients rarely have access to their full medical records.
In this project Blockchain is explored as a solution to the above mentioned issues.

The project aims to leverage Hyperledger to provide a better way to store, share and protect sensitive information like healthcare data. The project is intended to store all of a patient’s information in one place, making it simpler for patients and doctors to view and interact.
Each interaction with a patient’s medical data is auditable, transparent and secure, and will be recorded as a transaction on the ledger. During this process, the patient’s privacy is protected at all times.

The Hyperledger blockchain securely stores health records and maintains a single version of the truth. Different medical organizations and individuals — like doctors, hospitals, labs, and insurers — can request permission to access a patient’s record from blockchain. 

Patients have more control over who sees their data, while healthcare providers can provide better patient care based on more accurate data.

### Tools

#### Hyperledger Fabric
Hyperledger Fabric is a blockchain framework implementation and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by The Linux Foundation. Hyperledger Fabric allows components, such as consensus and membership services, to be plug-and-play. Hyperledger Fabric leverages container technology to host smart contracts called “Chaincode” that comprise the application logic of the system.

#### Hyperledger Composer

Hyperledger Composer is a set of collaboration tools for building blockchain business networks that make it simple and fast for business owners and developers to create smart contracts and blockchain applications to solve business problems. Built with JavaScript, leveraging modern tools including node.js, npm, CLI and popular editors.
